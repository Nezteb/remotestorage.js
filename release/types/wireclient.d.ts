/**
 * This file exposes a get/put/delete interface on top of fetch() or XMLHttpRequest.
 * It requires to be configured with parameters about the remotestorage server to
 * connect to.
 * Each instance of WireClient is always associated with a single remotestorage
 * server and access token.
 *
 * Usually the WireClient instance can be accessed via `remoteStorage.remote`.
 *
 * This is the get/put/delete interface:
 *
 *   - #get() takes a path and optionally a ifNoneMatch option carrying a version
 *     string to check. It returns a promise that will be fulfilled with the HTTP
 *     response status, the response body, the MIME type as returned in the
 *     'Content-Type' header and the current revision, as returned in the 'ETag'
 *     header.
 *   - #put() takes a path, the request body and a content type string. It also
 *     accepts the ifMatch and ifNoneMatch options, that map to the If-Match and
 *     If-None-Match headers respectively. See the remotestorage-01 specification
 *     for details on handling these headers. It returns a promise, fulfilled with
 *     the same values as the one for #get().
 *   - #delete() takes a path and the ifMatch option as well. It returns a promise
 *     fulfilled with the same values as the one for #get().
 *
 * In addition to this, the WireClient has some compatibility features to work with
 * remotestorage 2012.04 compatible storages. For example it will cache revisions
 * from folder listings in-memory and return them accordingly as the "revision"
 * parameter in response to #get() requests. Similarly it will return 404 when it
 * receives an empty folder listing, to mimic remotestorage-01 behavior. Note
 * that it is not always possible to know the revision beforehand, hence it may
 * be undefined at times (especially for caching-roots).
